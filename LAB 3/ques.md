Q.1) Write a python program to find the number of items available in the list, then find the
largest and smallest number from a list. Also find sum of all the items in a list.
Q.2) Write a python program to check whether a specific number is available within a list or
not. If it is found, then display its position.
Q.3) Write a python program to input the elements of the list dynamically during the
execution and sort the elements of the list in descending order. Now create another list and
join the second list with the first, then display the resultant list.
Q.4) Write a Python program that takes a list and prints a new list with unique elements of
the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Q.5) Write a python program to remove a specific element in the given list and display the
updated list. Also remove all the elements from the list.
Q.6) Write a python program to create two lists as A (having 5 elements) and B (having 7
elements). Now copy all the elements of ‘A’ to the ‘B’, so both set will be exactly same.
Q.7) Write a python program to reverse a tuple and remove a specific element from the
tuple. Then combine this one with another tuple.
Q.8) Write a python program to find frequency of a specific element in the given tuple. Also
find the index positions of this element.
Q.9) Write a python program to insert an element at specific position of tuple by making it
mutable then make it immutable and display the tuple elements.
Q.10) Given a list of integers, write a Python program to find the longest increasing
subsequence. The function should return the length of the subsequence and the subsequence
itself. Ensure that the subsequence is a continuous subsequence (not necessarily unique).

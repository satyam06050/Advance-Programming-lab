DAY-4 Experiments

[Set, Dictionaries, Array, User Defined Function]

Q.1) Write a python program to create a set and add some elements in it, also add repeating
elements, then print the set. Now create another set and perform set operations such as
union, intersection and difference.
Q.2) Write a python program to check if a set is a subset of another set or not.
Q.3) Write a python program that takes two sets of integers as input and returns a new set
containing all the elements that are common to both sets, but the common elements should
be raised to the power of 2.
Q.4) Write a python program to create an immutable set with some elements and print it
using iterator. Now add a new element to this set and print the updated one.
Q.5) Write a python program to create a dictionary with a set of key value pair and fetch the
value according to the specified key. Now create an empty dictionary and add the key value
pairs to it, then concatenate two dictionaries to create a new one.
Q.6) Write a python program to sort a dictionary by key. Also remove a specific key from
this dictionary.
Q.7) Write a python program that takes a list of words and returns a dictionary that maps
each word to its frequency in the list.
Q.8) Write a python program to find the factorial of a number using user-defined function.
Q.9) Take a list of integers as an input and then find the sum of all the elements in a list
using recursive function.
Q.10) Write a Python program to calculate the square and cube of every number in a given
list of integers using user-defined function.
Q.11) Write a Python program to sort the elements of a list using Lambda function.

Q.1) Write a python program which computes the multiplication of two 100 * 100 matrices.
Compare the running time of implementation using python lists and implementation using
the NumPy arrays. To compute the running time of a program, you can use time module of
python.
Q.2) Write a python code to create a 2-D NumPy array (10 x 5) with random numbers
between 1 to 100. Now print the followings -
i) Sum of odd numbers in array
ii) Sum of even numbers in array
iii) Sum of diagonal elements in array
iv) Transpose of the array
v) 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th row of the array
vi) Multiply 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th rows by -1 and print the updated array
vii) Flatten the sub-matrix made using 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th rows and print the
flattened array
viii) Sum of all elements in the array
ix) Mean of all elements in the array
x) Median of all elements in array
xi) Standard Deviation of all elements in array
xii) Flatten entire array and sort in increasing order
Q.3) Write a python code to create a class that allows to manage arbitrary two-dimensional
arrays and to:
a. Produce a new array from the original, in which the elements of each row are in
reverse order.
b. Produce another one, where the rows are in reverse order.
c. Produce an array from m, where columns and rows are in reverse order.
d. Produce another one, where the first and last row and the first and last column are
cut.
Q.4) Solve the following systems of linear equations -
i) x + 2y = -4, 2x + 4y = -8
ii) x + 2y + 3z = 6, 2x - 3y + 2z = 14, 3x + y - z = -2 using inverse matrix method.
Q.5) Create a 10 x 10 NumPy array with 1s on perimeter and 0s inside.
Q.6) Write a function in python to flatten a given 2D array into a 1D array without using
built-in NumPy functions like flatten() or ravel().
Q.7) Implement a python function to reverse the rows of a 2D array in-place.
Q.8) Create a checkerboard pattern (8x8) using NumPy arrays, where the alternating
squares are 0 and 1.
Q.9) Create a 3D array (3x3x3) in python and slice it to obtain a 2D array containing the
middle row of each 2D subarray.
Q.10) Given two arrays A and B in python, find the common elements between them
without using loops.
